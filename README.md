# Game Boy Emulator

Hello all, this here is a Game Boy emulator that I am currently working on. I am using [Pan Docs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Memory_Map.html) for all the hardware information.
By the time this is finished it will hopefully include a fully fleshed out Game Boy Color and Original Game Boy compatibility with sound as well.

## TODO:
-   Joypad Input
-   Cartridge things
-   Serial Data Transfer
-   Finish Interrurpts
-   VRAM DMA transfer
-   A lot of instructions
-   Combine parts into Memory class
-   Create final cycle accurate Game Boy CPU loop
